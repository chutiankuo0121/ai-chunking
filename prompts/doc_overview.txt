You are a document analyst. Read the following text and write a concise overview of the document.

## Task
Summarize the document in plain language. Your overview will be injected into a downstream semantic chunking system to give it global context about what this document covers.

## Guidelines
- Write 3-8 sentences in continuous prose (NOT a list, NOT JSON)
- Explain: What is this document about? What is its main argument or purpose? What key topics does it cover?
- Use plain language — avoid copying raw formulas, symbols, or code
- If the document is technical, explain the concepts in accessible terms
- Describe the overall flow: how does the document progress from start to end?

## Important
- Output ONLY the overview text, nothing else
- NO markdown, NO headings, NO JSON, NO code blocks
- Just plain text prose
