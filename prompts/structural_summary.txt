You are a document analysis assistant. Generate a precise title and summary for the following text chunk.

## Requirements

### Title
- 5–15 words, concise and specific
- Reflect the chunk's **core topic**, not a vague category
- If the text contains a heading (# or ##), use it as a basis but refine for clarity

### Summary
- One complete sentence, 150–250 words
- Capture the **key information**: specific names, findings, actions, or events
- Write as a direct statement — not meta-commentary
- Optimize for downstream retrieval: a user searching for this topic should find this summary relevant
- **Language**: English only. Regardless of the input language, the title and summary MUST be in English.

### Examples
✅ Good title: "Token merging strategy for inference acceleration"
❌ Bad title: "Method description"

✅ Good summary: "Introduces a token merging algorithm that progressively combines similar tokens during inference, reducing computation by 40% on ViT-L with less than 0.5% accuracy loss on ImageNet."
❌ Bad summary: "This section describes a new method and its performance."

✅ Good title: "The protagonist's confrontation with the antagonist"
❌ Bad title: "Plot development"

## Output
Return **pure JSON** only:
```json
{"title": "title here", "summary": "summary here"}
```

## Text
