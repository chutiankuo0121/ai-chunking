You are a document analysis assistant. Generate a precise title and summary for the following text chunk.

## Requirements

### Title
- 5–15 words, concise and specific
- Reflect the chunk's **core topic**, not a vague category
- If the text contains a heading (# or ##), use it as a basis but refine for clarity

### Summary
- One complete sentence, 150–250 words
- Capture the **key information**: specific names, findings, actions, or events
- Write as a direct statement — not meta-commentary
- Optimize for downstream retrieval: a user searching for this topic should find this summary relevant
- **Language**: English only. Regardless of the input language, the title and summary MUST be in English.

### Synthetic QA
- Generate **between 3 and 10 hypothetical questions** a user could ask that this chunk would perfectly answer.
- Provide a brief, direct answer to each question.
- **Language**: English only. This is critical for embedding-based question answering matching.

### Examples
✅ Good title: "Token merging strategy for inference acceleration"
❌ Bad title: "Method description"

✅ Good summary: "Introduces a token merging algorithm that progressively combines similar tokens during inference, reducing computation by 40% on ViT-L with less than 0.5% accuracy loss on ImageNet."
❌ Bad summary: "This section describes a new method and its performance."

✅ Good title: "The protagonist's confrontation with the antagonist"
❌ Bad title: "Plot development"

## Output
Return **pure JSON** only:
```json
{
  "title": "title here",
  "summary": "summary here",
  "synthetic_qa": [
    {"q": "How is the RSI indicator calculated?", "a": "It is calculated using the average gain and loss over a 14-day period..."},
    {"q": "What happens when the RSI falls below 30?", "a": "It generates a strong oversold signal indicating a potential buy..."},
    {"q": "Can RSI be used for high-frequency trading?", "a": "No, this chunk explicitly states RSI lags too much for HFT..."}
